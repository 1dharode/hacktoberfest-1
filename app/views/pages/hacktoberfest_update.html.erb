    <h1 class="title">Shared commitment to reducing spam with Hacktoberfest</h1>
    
    <p><em>Posted 10/01/2020 13:00 UTC</em></p>

    <p>Since the start of Hacktoberfest 2020, open source maintainers have experienced a noticeable uptick in spammy pull requests originating from Hacktoberfest participants. As of October 1st 2pm PST, at least 4% of pull requests from Hacktoberfest participants have been marked ‘invalid’ or ‘spam.’</p>

    <p>We’ve traced the majority of the spammy contributions back to a participant with a large online audience who openly encouraged their community to “search for websites in Github, add “Amazing project” to the READMEs, and then send the PR.” We’ve requested that they take this down, but the truth is that this is a symptom of a larger problem we still want to address.</p>

    <h2 class="title_small">What we&rsquo;re doing about it (right now):</h2>

    <p><strong class="underline">Excluding and Banning:</strong></p>
    
    <p>In past years, we tried labelling issues “invalid” and “spam” to deter participants from spamming repositories. Unfortunately this has not made as much impact as we had hoped. Therefore, we’re adding two new ways to discourage participants from spamming repositories.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>For maintainers, we’re building on an existing idea and doubling down on an <strong>excluded repository list</strong> for Hacktoberfest. If you don’t want pull requests to your repositories counted toward Hacktoberfest, add them to <a href="/report">this list</a>.</li>
      <li>We’re also implementing a <strong>banning system</strong> that reviews and bans users with just two or more flagged PR’s. This can result in exclusion from all future Hacktoberfests, not just this one.</li>
      <li>In previous years, we created a one-week validation period to give maintainers time to review pull requests and force contributors to wait before earning their shirt. This year, we’re <strong>extending the validation period</strong> to be 14 days.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong class="underline">Onboarding Overhaul:</strong></p>

    <p>For participants of Hacktoberfest the first step is always the onboarding journey of connecting their GitHub account, sharing their email, and agreeing to the program rules. Since we know that many participants skip over this important step, we’re creating a <strong>mandatory onboarding flow</strong> requiring each new participant to learn the rules and some specific Do’s and Don'ts. We will also share this information with the nearly 100K participants who have already registered.</p> 

    <p>We have tapped our friends at DEV to help educate the community on what is expected and what activity we ban. Going forward, every participant will have an <strong>entirely revamped profile page</strong> to highlight a few key pieces of information. We want to educate users so they can provide quality contributions. However, we will also include some ways for them to more easily earn a shirt so they don’t need to resort to spamming.</p>

    <p><strong class="underline">Communicating Our Community's Concern:</strong></p>

    <p>We also know communication is key and we can’t solve this issue all on our own. We plan to talking to maintainers across the community so we can hear more about their experience with Hacktoberfest and come up with solutions together. We’re setting up 20 maintainer roundtable sessions over the next week in all global time zones to gather feedback and ideas.</p> 

    <p>Lastly, we’re working closely with our sponsors to find more and more ways to reduce the amount of spam. A few shining examples of this is GitHub’s new addition of <a href="https://twitter.com/github/status/1311772722234560517">interaction limits</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="title_small">Where (else) Do We Go From Here?</h2>

    <p><strong>To the maintainers:</strong> We’re sorry that these unintended consequences of Hacktoberfest have made more work for many of you. We know there is more work to do, which is why we ask that you please join us for a community roundtable discussion where we promise to listen and take actions based on your ideas.</p>
    
    <p><strong>To the event organizers and attendees:</strong> We’re committed to the original mission of getting people positively involved in open source. For all the folks who have had events already, we thank you for your support and your contributions to the community.</p>

    <p><strong>To the contributors:</strong> We know that Hacktoberfest has been a rewarding experience for many of you and we don’t want to lose sight of that. We ask that you please refrain from making spammy contributions that undermine the  rules and values of Hacktoberfest. We know the majority of our participants are here to learn and grow through quality contributions. <strong>Please continue to help us make a positive impact on the community</strong> by <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details">reading the resources</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/whos-participating-in-hacktoberfest-2020-gh1s">connecting with others on DEV</a>, or <a href="https://raise.dev/hacktoberfest">joining a helpdesk session</a>.</p> 

    <p>As always, our Hacktoberfest communication channels are wide open. We review every inquiry that comes our way and we look forward to hearing and learning from this year’s Hacktoberfest to make it better. You can email us at <a href="mailto:hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com">hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com</a> if you have more ideas on how we can improve Hacktoberfest and give back to the open source community.</p>

      Thank you and happy hacking,
