      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.</p>

      <h1 id="participation-rules" class="title is-1"><a href="#participation-rules">Participation rules</a></h1>
      <p>To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt,
        you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between
        October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public
        repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest.
        If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in
        line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to
        participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully
        complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088
        earned a shirt!)</p>

      <p>In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun,
        quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we
        consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove
        whitespace/optimize images)</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making
        a PR) </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray
        whitespace... not. </p>

      <p>Inspired by you – the community – through your actions and stories.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> <b>Everyone is welcome!</b> Hacktoberfest participants
        have represented 151 countries and thousands of unique skill sets. Our
        program welcomes everyone already in the open source software community – and
        anyone interested in diving in.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> <b>Quantity is fun, quality is key!</b> Participating
        in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and
        community building. And it all begins with meaningful contributions to
        open source technology.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">●</span> <b>Short-term actions, long-term impact!</b> In the
        open source community, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before
        us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long
        after October comes to an end. This is a voyage, not a race.</p>
