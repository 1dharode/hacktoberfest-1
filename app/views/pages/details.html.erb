    <p><span class="highlight">*</span> Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">*</span> Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">*</span> You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.</p>

    <h1 class="title is-1">Participation rules</h1>
    <p>To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt,
    you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between
    October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public 
    repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. 
    If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in 
    line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to 
    participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully 
    complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 
    earned a shirt!)</p>

  <div class="container details">
    <h1 class="title is-1">Quality standards</h1>
    <p>In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun,
     quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we
     consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span>  PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span>  PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR) </p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span>  PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not. </p>

    <h1 class="title is-1">Values</h1>
    <p>Inspired by you – the community – through your actions and stories.</p>
   <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Everyone is welcome! Hacktoberfest participants
    have represented 151 countries and thousands of unique skill sets. Our
    program welcomes everyone already in the open source software community – and
    anyone interested in diving in.</p>
   <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Quantity is fun, quality is key! Participating
      in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and
      community building. And it all begins with meaningful contributions to
      open source technology.</p>
   <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Short-term actions, long-term impact! In the
      open source community, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before
      us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long
      after October comes to an end. This is a voyage, not a race.</p>
