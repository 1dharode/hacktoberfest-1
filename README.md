# Hacktoberfest

## Features
* Static pages
* Airtable backed events and FAQs
* Issue discovery by language
* Log in with GitHub
* Multi-step registration
* Pull request timeline
* Challenge completion validation
* Prize distribution

## Components
There are three major components that are entirely separate from one another:

1. Issue discovery - Fetches issues from GitHub with the label `hacktoberfest` and persists them in the database to be featured on the homepage based on a randomized quality filter.

2. Content pages - Primarily static pages that are supplemented with dynamic data from Airtable.

3. Participant management - Allows users to register to participate in Hacktoberfest, tracks user progress, and distributes prizes based on availability. The majority of the business logic is implemented with a state machine, validating that various conditions are met before a user may be transitioned to a new state and with certain actions being triggered on successful state transitions.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your os is the latest MacOS

- Have brew installed (Run the following command in a mac os terminal to install):

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Installing

clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/raise-dev/hacktoberfest
```

In your local repository, run script/setup, which will install all necessary dependencies for you:

```
script/setup
```

### Running the project

There are two commands you will need for running the project.

First, spin up the rails server locally:

```
script/server
```

If you will be running any background jobs through sidekiq, run the following command in a separate terminal window from `script/server` which will spin up both redis and sidekiq:

```
script/sidekiq
```

## ENV Variables

### Github Client ID & Github Client Secret

Hacktoberfest uses `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` variables to configure OmniAuth.

This allows users to be authorized for Hacktoberfest via Github.

For this, you will have to create a Github OAuth App (https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps)

Be sure your OAuth app is configured with the following URLs

![Oauth Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7976757/66855839-fd259980-ef51-11e9-808b-26a9251841bf.png)

The Client ID and Client Secret are right above this congiguration, use them to set the following ENV variables: 

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

With these set, you can click the "Start Hacking" button on the nav bar and login with your github account (to your own app you just created).

This will create your user in the DB and therefore add your access token to the pool used by the app whenever it hits the GitHub API. 

This means you can run the rake command to import repositories looking for help through hacktoberfest (these are displayed on the homepage). If you don't run the task, there simply won't be any repositories on the homepage aside from the hard-coded climate change repos.

```bash
bin/rails github:fetch_popular_languages_projects
```

### Start Date & End Date

Hacktoberfest is officially active from October 1st - November 1st

The app can be in three different states:

* Pre-launch 
  - Users can sign up and all pages are reachable, but the profile page is not yet tracking pull requests
* Active
  - All pages are active and the profile is tracking PRs
* Finished
  - Hacktoberfest has declared its winners

So your dates can look something like this if you're developing in October 2019 and you want the app in the Active state.

```bash
 START_DATE="2019-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"
 END_DATE="2019-11-01 00:00:00 UTC"
```

If you want to work on the app in the `Pre-Launch` state, set the start date to a future date.
If you want to work on the app in the `Finished` state, set the end date to a past date.

### Airtable API Key & Airtable App ID

Hacktoberfest uses Airtable as a CMS to hold useful data such as:
  - Events
  - FAQ
  - Spam Repositories

For your convenience we have created two options:

##### Create an Airtable Database:

We created a read-only copy of what the Airtable database should look like.

With this you can create your own schema by following this format:
(https://airtable.com/shrqM142bVC1Gj2t8)

After youâ€™ve created and configured the schema of an Airtable base from the graphical interface,

your Airtable base will provide its own API to create, read, update, and destroy records.

You should update these variables accordingly in your `.env`

##### Use Placeholder Airtable Service

If configuring your own Airtable schema does not sound like your cup of tea - don't fret.

We have created placeholder service objects that will render test data if your Airtable keys are not set.

This service will be used as default.

You can find this service in `app/services/airtable_placehoder_service.rb`
