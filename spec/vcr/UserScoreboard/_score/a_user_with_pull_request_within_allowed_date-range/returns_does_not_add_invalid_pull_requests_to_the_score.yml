        believe these changes nicely accommodate both my concerns for having the full

        simply instructs evil-insert-state to use `hybrid-mode-insert-state-map` instead.
        `hybrid-mode-insert-state-map` is set to inherit from `evil-emacs-state-map`
        with the few essential changes made for escaping correctly. This simplifies
        the code quite a bit and works great with `helm-descbinds`.\n\n@justbur, @syl20bnr
